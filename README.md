# Fluff It Out
This project was made for a university assignment as a team of 2 programmers and 3 designers, using the Unity game engine.

The brief of the assignment was to create a couch co-op (splitscreen) game where two or more players could play against each other in some sort of adversarial gamemode. 

As our entry into the assignment we created an arena fight game where you play as a child's soft toy and fight against each other, inspired by pixar's toy story but given a bit of a more mature theme of having the toys fight to the death. The gameplay takes place in a child's bedroom on their table covered in toys.

The players can select a character to play as out of a choice of a; rabbit, bear, dog, cat and bird. Each player spawns in their own corner of the map and once the game begins they must traverse the map and find weapon pickups to use to defeat each other. 

These weapons include such things as: scissors, glue gun, glitter bombs, nail gun and more. In the centre of the map was the ultimate weapon spawn point which would spawn in more powerful weapons that could be used to turn the tide of the game, these weapons include items such as; the void grenade (a grenade that pulls all enemies in range into the centre and slowly damages them), a minigun (a weapon that fires at a higher rate than the rest and gives the user a bit of health in return when damaging an opposing player) and more.

# Controls
This game was developed using the Unity input system package that was developed by Unity themselves in order to allow more customisation of control schemes. 
The control basis of this game was developed for an xbox gamepad.

# My Work
My Contribution to the project was to create the main gameplay systems for the game, this included the player controller, weapon functionality, player scoring, map objects like the train going around the map, and more. 

All my Scripts I've written can be found in the folder "Skylar's Scripts" under the scripts folder in the assets:
